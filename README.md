Exactly what you think it does. When you visit the Washington Post website it removes the paywall that blocks you from seeing the whole article. The full text of the article has already been downloaded, they just don't allow you to scroll down to read it. This removes those limitations.

#### Demo
![indeed](doc-img/job-indeed.gif)

#### Configuration
The key words that will be highlighted are split up into several categories, all of which are highlighted in different colors
| Property                     | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                 |
|:-----------------------------|:-----------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `flagSecurityClearances`     | `boolean`  | `true` by default - When `true` it will add words related to obtaining a security clearance to the list of flagged terms                    |
| `flagCriminalRecord`         | `boolean`  | `false` by default - When `true` it will add words related to a criminal history, or a background check to the list of flagged terms        |
| `descriptionAlwaysHighlight` | `string[]` | words to always highlight in **yellow** when found in a job description                                                                     |
| `descriptionAlwaysFlag`      | `string[]` | words to always highlight in **red** as "flagged" terms. Not necessarily bad things, but things to be sure you are aware of before applying |
| `workTypesAlwaysHighlight`   | `string[]` | words to always highlight in **purple** as the job type (full time, part time, W2, etc.)                                                    |
| `locationHighlightPattern`   | `RexExp`   | the location(s) of your choice. Defaults to anything remote or in the Charlotte, NC area (that's where I live, change it to your location!) |

For example, when looking for a remote position there are lots of jobs that say "remote from Los Angeles, CA". If you don't live in that city, even though it's remote it doesn't really apply to you. This allows you to highlight the location if it is simply "remote" (with no location) or you can specify things to look for in the location to highlight them for the locations you are interested in.
How to use

After installing you will need to edit the configuration variables described above to match whatever your preferences are.

| `editorIndentSpaces`             | `number`     | number of spaces to use when indenting code.                                                                 |
| `commentSnippets`                | `object[]`   | Each comment snippet has a display `name` property and a `text` property which contains the actual comment   |

## Washington Post Paywall Remover
**[ðŸ“œ Install Autofill MyWorkday Jobs Resume Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FiniteLooper/UserScripts/main/src/autofill-myworkdayjobs-resume.user.js)**

Applying for jobs via MyWorkday Jobs is cumbersome because many companies use them, but you have to create a new account for each company and re-enter your same resume for each company. It's the same website and yet they don't allow you to import a previously used resume.  This script allow you to store your resume in a JSON format and it puts some buttons in the UI at each step of the application. Just press the buttons and it will auto-fill your details for that step. It saves me a LOT of time if I am applying to many jobs.

Note that options in dropdown menus can change between companies, I guess they can provide their own values. A good example is your gender or ethnicity for the demographic data.
```
ethnicity: [
  "White",
  "White (Not Hispanic or Latino)",
  "White (United States of America)",
  "White (Not Hispanic or Latino) (United States of America)",
],
```
or the degree type for education
```
degreeType: [
  "Bachelor of Science (B.S.)",
  "Bachelors of Science",
  "Bachelor's of Science",
  "Bachelor of Science",
  "BS",
  "Bachelor's Degree",
  "Bachelors Degree",
  "Bachelor Degree",
  "Bachelors",
  "Bachelor",
],
```

The script will do it's best to find a match, and if multiples are found it will select which ever one is first in the provided array.
